fibonacci-word-clock
====================
An aesthetically pleasing clock. Displays an animation composed of recursively nested rotating circles, arranged 
in the pattern of the FibonacciWord (BABBABABBABBA.... for more info, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word).

Each second, the orbits of the circles align to a degree in accordance with the "significance" of the change in time. At the beginning of a new hour, for example, the circles will group up into very large strings. At the beginning of a new minute, the circles will group into shorter strings. The clock reacts to other time intervals as well, such as 15 minutes, and 30 seconds.

The clock changes colors throughout the day.
