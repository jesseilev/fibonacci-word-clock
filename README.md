fibonacci-word-clock
====================
An aesthetically pleasing clock. Displays an animation of recursively nested rotating circles, arranged 
in the pattern of the FibonacciWord: 'BABBABABBABBA....' (for more info, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word).

Each second, the orbits of the circles align to a degree in accordance with the "significance" of the current time. At 12 noon, for example, the "planets align" into a perfectly straight line. At less significant time intervals, such as every fifteen minutes, they align to a lesser degree, in small groups, like a string cut into many pieces.

The clock's color scheme changes throughout the day.
