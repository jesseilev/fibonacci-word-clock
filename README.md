fibonacci-word-clock
====================
An aesthetically pleasing clock. Displays an animation of recursively nested rotating circles, arranged 
in the pattern of the FibonacciWord (BABBABABBABBA.... for more info, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word).

Each second, the orbits of the circles align to a degree in accordance with the "significance" of the change in time. At the beginning of a new hour, for example, the circles will group up into very large strings. At the beginning of a new minute, they will group into shorter strings. In addition to 1 hour and 1 minute, the clock responds simlilarly to other common time intervals, such as 15 minutes, and 30 seconds.

The color scheme changes throughout the day.
